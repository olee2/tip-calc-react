## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Javascript

### What I learned

This is my first project using React. I did the same challenge a while back with Vanilla JS, and I figured I could re-do the project as this is a single-page app suited for React.

I learned a lot about using the useState and useEffect hooks, as well as the process of drilling props into different component levels.
